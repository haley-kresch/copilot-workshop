1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**.
2. Run `./gradlew build` or use the Gradle tool window to build.
3. Run tests with `./gradlew test`.

## 🎯 Demo Tasks

### 1\. Clarity (`Clarity.java`)
\- **Purpose:** Demonstrates how clear, specific prompts improve Copilot’s code suggestions.
\- **Usage:** Try Out to see examples of vague vs\. clear instructions.

### 2\. Context (`Context.java`)
\- **Purpose:** Shows how providing context in prompts leads to more relevant code completions.
\- **Usage:** Try Out to compare completions with and without context.

### 3\. Role Prompting (`RolePrompting.java`)
\- **Purpose:** Illustrates assigning a role or persona to Copilot for tailored code generation.
\- **Usage:** Try Out to see how role-based instructions affect output.

### 4\. Few-Shot (`FewShot.java`)
\- **Purpose:** Demonstrates few-shot prompting by providing examples in the prompt.
\- **Usage:** Try Out to observe how example-based prompts guide Copilot.

### 5\. Chain-of-Thought (`ChainOfThought.java`)
\- **Purpose:** Shows step-by-step reasoning in prompts for complex tasks.
\- **Usage:** Try Out to see how breaking down problems improves code quality.

### 6\. Iterative Refinement (`IterativeRefinement.java`)
\- **Purpose:** Demonstrates refining code through multiple prompt iterations.
\- **Usage:** Try Out to follow the process of incremental code improvement.

### 7\. Negative Prompting (`NegativePrompting.java`)
\- **Purpose:** Illustrates how negative instructions \(what not to do\) affect Copilot’s output.
\- **Usage:** Try Out to see the impact of exclusionary prompts.
