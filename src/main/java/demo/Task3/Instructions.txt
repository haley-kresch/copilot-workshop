Exercise 1 — Single Example (Vague)
-----------------------------------
Prompt Copilot with just one minimal example.

Example prompt:
Add a method named `getFullName` that returns 'United States' if the input is 'US'.

Observe:
- How well does Copilot generalize from a single example?
- Does it infer other mappings automatically?
- Are the naming and structure consistent with your expectations?


Exercise 2 — Multiple Consistent Examples
-----------------------------------------
Provide several examples with clear, consistent formatting to guide Copilot’s pattern recognition.

Example prompt:
    Add a method that maps:
      'US' → 'United States'
      'FR' → 'France'
      'JP' → 'Japan'
    Then extend the mapping for other codes.

Observe:
- Does Copilot infer the pattern correctly?
- Does it format the code consistently?
- How does it handle additional examples or edge cases?
