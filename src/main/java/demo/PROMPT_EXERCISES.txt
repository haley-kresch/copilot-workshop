# Prompt Engineering Exercises

This file contains all the prompt engineering exercises extracted from the demo classes. For each exercise, refer to the specified Java class in the `demo` package.

## Clarity.java

**Exercise 1:**
Give Copilot a vague prompt and observe results.
Example: "Add a method that works with numbers."

**Exercise 2:**
Refine the same idea with clarity.
Example: "Add a method that takes a list of integers and returns the sum as an int."

**Exercise 3:**
Now add specificity (context, format, constraints).
Example: "Add a static method named calculateAverage(List<Integer> numbers) that:
  - Returns 0.0 if the list is null or empty
  - Uses Java Streams for the calculation
  - Includes JavaDoc with @param and @return tags
  - Has no side effects"

---

## Context.java

**Exercise 1:**
Give Copilot a minimal, vague context.
Example: "Add a method to process scores."
Observe: Copilot may generate many different interpretations.

**Exercise 2:**
Add explicit CONTEXT (domain, audience, task).
Example: "Add a method for teachers that calculates the class average from a list of student scores."

**Exercise 3:**
Add both CONTEXT + BACKGROUND (data, assumptions, prior steps).
Example: "Add a static method named calculatePassRate(List<Integer> scores) that:
  - Uses a passing threshold of 70
  - Returns a double between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the ratio of students passing
  - Assumes scores are integers between 0 and 100
  - Includes JavaDoc with @param and @return
  - Has deterministic, testable behavior"

## RolePrompting.java

**Exercise 1:**
Vague prompt (no role given).
Example: "Add a method to check these logs."
Observe: Copilot may give generic or unfocused output.

**Exercise 2:**
Add a ROLE prompt for more control.
Example: "You are a senior DevOps Engineer. Add a method named findErrors(List<String> logs) that:
  - Scans logs for lines containing 'ERROR'
  - Returns them as a List<String>
  - Handles null/empty lists gracefully"

**Exercise 3:**
Explore other roles and tasks:
- "You are a Java code reviewer. Suggest improvements for readability."
- "You are a technical writer. Document this method with clear JavaDoc."
- "You are a security engineer. Review this code for vulnerabilities."
Compare tone, style, and domain-specific relevance in each case.

## FewShot.java

**Exercise 1:**
Prompt Copilot with just one vague example.
Example: "Add a method to map 'US' → 'United States'."
Observe: Copilot may not generalize well.

**Exercise 2:**
Add 2–5 examples with consistent formatting.
Example: "Add a method that maps:
  'US' → 'United States'
  'FR' → 'France'
  'JP' → 'Japan'
Then extend the mapping for other codes."

**Exercise 3:**
Avoid contradictions.
Example: Don't include both "US → United States" and "US → America" in the same set.

## ChainOfThought.java

**Exercise 1:**
Give a vague prompt.
Example: "Add a method to calculate factorial."
Observe: Copilot may only return the result, no reasoning.

**Exercise 2:**
Add clarity by asking for reasoning.
Example: "Add a method computeFactorialWithSteps(int n) that:
  - Prints each multiplication step
  - Returns the final result"

**Exercise 3:**
Use full chain-of-thought prompting.
Example: "Add a method solveQuadraticWithExplanation(double a, double b, double c) that:
  - Explains discriminant calculation step by step
  - Shows intermediate values
  - Returns an array of roots (or empty if complex)"

## IterativeRefinement.java

**Exercise 1 (vague):**
Prompt: "Add a method to generate a simple report from scores."
Observe: Copilot may produce a single draft without refinements.

**Exercise 2 (clear):**
Prompt: "Add a method generateDraftReport(List<Integer> scores)
  - Shows student count, average, min, max, and all scores"

**Exercise 3 (iterative refinement):**
Prompt: "Add a method refineReport(String draft, String feedback, List<Integer> scores)
  - Applies one small, deterministic change per feedback round
  - Examples:
      - 'Add pass rate' → append pass rate with threshold 70
      - 'Make concise' → return a single-line summary
      - 'Return JSON' → convert report to JSON"

**Exercise 4 (advanced / code review simulation):**
Prompt: "Add a method iterativeRefinement(List<Integer> scores, List<String> feedbackRounds)
  - Returns a history of drafts after each feedback
  - Shows changes applied step by step"

## NegativePrompting.java

**Exercise 1 (vague):**
Prompt: "Add a method to generate a report from scores."
Observe: Copilot may include unwanted formatting, comments, or redundant info.

**Exercise 2 (positive guidance):**
Prompt: "Add a method generateReport(List<Integer> scores)
  - Include student count, average, min, and max
  - Format clearly for managers"

**Exercise 3 (negative prompting):**
Prompt: "Modify generateReport so it avoids:
  - Using abbreviations like 'avg' or 'cnt'
  - Printing unnecessary debug info
  - Including raw lists of scores unless requested
  - Adding redundant explanations"

**Exercise 4 (combined prompting):**
Prompt: "Generate documentation for the report method:
  - Use clear JavaDoc
  - Avoid verbose language and subjective opinions
  - Include only parameters and return value explanation"
