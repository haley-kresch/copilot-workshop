Example: Add a method to find the errors in the given logs

Vague Prompt:
    Add a method to find the errors in the given logs

Role Prompting Example::
    You are a senior DevOps Engineer. Add a method named findErrors(List<String> logs) that:
      - Scans logs for lines containing 'ERROR'
      - Returns them as a List<String>
      - Handles null or empty lists gracefully

Your Task: Extract the performance metrics from the given logs

Part 1: Send in the meeting chat (and try out in Copilot) a vague prompt (without role prompting) first

Part 2: Create a prompt that includes role prompting, following what you've learned
 from the Google Slides(feel free to use the example above as a guide).
 Try it out in Copilot and send it in the meeting chat.
