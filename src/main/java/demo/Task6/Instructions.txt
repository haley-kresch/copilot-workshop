## RolePrompting.java

Exercise 1 — No Role (Vague Prompt)
-----------------------------------
Start by giving Copilot a prompt with no defined role or context.

Example prompt:
    Add a method to check these logs.

Observe:
- What kind of method does Copilot generate?
- Does it correctly infer what "check" means (validate, filter, or analyze)?
- How relevant is the output to a Java logging use case?

Exercise 2 — Add a Role (Guided Context)
----------------------------------------
Now specify a professional role to influence Copilot’s reasoning and style.

Example prompt:
    You are a senior DevOps Engineer. Add a method named findErrors(List<String> logs) that:
      - Scans logs for lines containing 'ERROR'
      - Returns them as a List<String>
      - Handles null or empty lists gracefully

Goal:
Observe how defining a role improves focus, tone, and technical quality.


Exercise 3 — Explore Other Roles
--------------------------------
Experiment with different professional perspectives to see how each shapes Copilot’s response.

Example prompts:
    You are a Java code reviewer. Suggest improvements for readability.
    You are a technical writer. Document this method with clear JavaDoc.
    You are a security engineer. Review this code for vulnerabilities.

Goal:
Recognize how role-based prompting creates domain-specific outputs —
from code reviews and documentation to security-focused insights.
