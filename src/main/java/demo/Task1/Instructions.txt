## Clarity.java

Exercise 1 — Vague Prompt (Low Clarity)
---------------------------------------
Give Copilot a vague instruction related to the existing class.

Example prompt:
    Add a method that works with the student name.

Observe:
- What kind of method does Copilot generate?

(You don’t need to keep this version — the goal is to see how ambiguity leads to unpredictable results.)


Exercise 2 — Add Clarity
-------------------------
Refine your prompt to be unambiguous about inputs, outputs, and purpose, while still simple.

Example prompt:
    Add a method named createPersonalGreeting that returns a String message saying
    'Welcome, <studentName>!' without printing anything.


(Now you’ll see how clear instructions produce a predictable, reusable method.)


Exercise 3 — Add Specificity (Context + Format + Constraints)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Now make your prompt fully specific — include constraints, formatting details, and style.

Example prompt:
    Add a static method named summarizeGreetings(List<Clarity> students) that:
      - Returns a single String with all students’ names joined by commas
      - Returns 'No students found' if the list is null or empty
      - Uses Java Streams for the operation
      - Includes JavaDoc with @param and @return tags
      - Has no side effects (no printing to console)
