## Clarity.java

Example: Create a method that summarizes greetings for a list of students

Vague prompt:
    Add a method that summarizes greetings


Specific, clear prompt:
    Add a static method named summarizeGreetings(List<Clarity> students) that:
      - Returns a single String with all students’ names joined by commas
      - Returns 'No students found' if the list is null or empty
      - Uses Java Streams for the operation
      - Includes JavaDoc with @param and @return tags
      - Has no side effects (no printing to console)

Your Task:

Add a method to this class to greet a student, with the greeting being
specific to the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening).

Part 1: Send in the meeting chat (and try out in Copilot) a vague prompt first

Part 2: Create a more specific, clear prompt, following what you've learned from the Google Slide
        (feel free to use the example above as a guide). Try it out in Copilot and send it in the meeting chat.
