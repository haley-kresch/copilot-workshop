Example: Add a method to generate a report

Vague Prompt:
    Add a method to generate a report from scores.

Negative Prompting Example::
        Add a method generateReport(List<Integer> scores) that:
          - Includes student count, average, min, and max
          - Formats clearly for managers
          Make sure it avoids:
                - Using abbreviations like 'avg' or 'cnt'
                - Printing unnecessary debug info
                - Including raw lists of scores unless requested
                - Adding redundant explanations


Your Task: Add a method to generate a summary of the given scores

Part 1: Send in the meeting chat (and try out in Copilot) a vague prompt first

Part 2: Create a prompt that explicitly states what NOT to include, following what you've learned
 from the Google Slides(feel free to use the example above as a guide).
 Try it out in Copilot and send it in the meeting chat.
