Exercise 1 — Vague Prompt
-------------------------
Prompt:
    Add a method to generate a report from scores.

Observe:
- Copilot may include unwanted formatting, excessive comments, or redundant information.
- Output may mix return values and printing inconsistently.
- Note whether it produces a clean, professional report format.


Exercise 2 — Positive Guidance
-------------------------------
Prompt:
    Add a method generateReport(List<Integer> scores) that:
      - Includes student count, average, min, and max
      - Formats clearly for managers

Observe:
- Does Copilot follow formatting guidance and present results clearly?
- Are numeric calculations correct and consistent?
- Check for readability and structure of the report.


Exercise 3 — Negative Prompting
-------------------------------
Prompt:
    Modify generateReport so it avoids:
      - Using abbreviations like 'avg' or 'cnt'
      - Printing unnecessary debug info
      - Including raw lists of scores unless requested
      - Adding redundant explanations

Observe:
- Does Copilot correctly suppress undesired elements?
- Are instructions followed precisely without introducing new errors?
- Note how negative prompts affect style and content focus.


Exercise 4 — Combined Prompting
-------------------------------
Prompt:
    Generate documentation for the report method:
      - Use clear JavaDoc
      - Avoid verbose language and subjective opinions
      - Include only parameters and return value explanation

Observe:
- Is the documentation concise and accurate?
- Does Copilot follow the combination of positive and negative guidance?
- Are @param and @return tags clear and complete?
