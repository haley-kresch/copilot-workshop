## Context.java

Example: Create a method to calculate the pass rate

Vague prompt:
    Add a method to process scores.

A prompt with context:
    Add a static method named calculatePassRate(List<Integer> scores) that:
      - Uses a passing threshold of 70
      - Returns a double between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the ratio of students passing
      - Assumes scores are integers between 0 and 100
      - Includes JavaDoc with @param and @return tags
      - Has deterministic, testable behavior (no randomness or side effects)

Your Task:

Add a method to this class to take a list of scores and come up with a short text report summarizing the scores

Part 1: Send in the meeting chat (and try out in Copilot) a vague prompt first

Part 2: Create a prompt with context, following what you've learned from the Google Slide
        (feel free to use the example above as a guide). Try it out in Copilot and send it in the meeting chat.
