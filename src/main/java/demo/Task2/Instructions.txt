## Context.java

Exercise 1 — Minimal Context (Vague)
------------------------------------
Give Copilot almost no context so it must infer your intent.

Example prompt:
    Add a method to process scores.

Observe:
- What kind of method does Copilot create? (Does it sort, print, average, or transform?)

Goal:
Recognize how lack of context leads to unpredictable or inconsistent results.


Exercise 2 — Add Explicit Context
---------------------------------
Now add clear information about the domain (education), audience (teachers), and task.

Example prompt:
    Add a method for teachers that calculates the class average from a list of student scores.

Goal:
See how adding domain and task context guides Copilot toward a consistent and relevant solution.


Exercise 3 — Add Context + Background
-------------------------------------
Finally, make your prompt fully explicit — include background data, assumptions, and constraints.

Example prompt:
    Add a static method named calculatePassRate(List<Integer> scores) that:
      - Uses a passing threshold of 70
      - Returns a double between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the ratio of students passing
      - Assumes scores are integers between 0 and 100
      - Includes JavaDoc with @param and @return tags
      - Has deterministic, testable behavior (no randomness or side effects)

Goal:
Observe how adding explicit CONTEXT (domain, purpose) and BACKGROUND (data, assumptions)
enables Copilot to produce precise, verifiable code.
