Example: Create a method to solve a quadratic equation

Vague Prompt:
    Add a method to solve a quadratic equation

CoT Prompting Example::
Add a method solveQuadraticWithExplanation(double a, double b, double c) that:
  - Explains discriminant calculation step by step
  - Shows intermediate values (discriminant, sqrt, numerator/denominator)
  - Returns an array of real roots (empty array if roots are complex)


Your Task: Create a method to shuffle a given string

Part 1: Send in the meeting chat (and try out in Copilot) a vague prompt (without CoT prompting) first

Part 2: Create a better prompt that includes CoT prompting, following what you've learned
 from the Google Slides(feel free to use the example above as a guide).
 Try it out in Copilot and send it in the meeting chat.
