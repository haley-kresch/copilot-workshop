## ChainOfThought.java

Exercise 1 — Vague Prompt
-------------------------
Give Copilot a minimal, vague instruction.

Example prompt:
    Add a method to calculate factorial.

Observe:
- Copilot may only return the final result with no explanation.
- Note whether it chooses an iterative or recursive approach.
- Check how it handles edge cases (n == 0, negative n) — are they addressed?


Exercise 2 — Ask for Reasoning (Clarity)
----------------------------------------
Make the prompt explicit about wanting step-by-step output.

Example prompt:
    Add a method computeFactorialWithSteps(int n) that:
      - Prints each multiplication step
      - Returns the final result

Observe:
- Does Copilot include the requested step-printing and still return the correct value?
- Does the implementation mix side effects and return values cleanly or awkwardly?


Exercise 3 — Full Explanation / Chain-of-Thought Style
-----------------------------------------------------
Request detailed, intermediate explanation and visible calculations.

Example prompt:
    Add a method solveQuadraticWithExplanation(double a, double b, double c) that:
      - Explains discriminant calculation step by step
      - Shows intermediate values (discriminant, sqrt, numerator/denominator)
      - Returns an array of real roots (empty array if roots are complex)

Observe:
- Is the explanation produced as console output, comments, or both?
- Are intermediate values computed and displayed accurately?
- How does Copilot handle complex roots or invalid input (a == 0)?
- Note whether the explanations are precise enough to be unit-tested or if they’re informal.
